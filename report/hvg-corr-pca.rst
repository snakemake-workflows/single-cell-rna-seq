PCA plot constructed from normalized log-expression values of correlated HVGs,
where each point represents a cell.

First, second, and third components are shown, along with the percentage of variance
explained. Bars represent the coordinates of the cells on each axis.
Cells were colored by {{ snakemake.wildcards.covariate }}.
