Density plot of the percentage of variance explained by various covariates.

For each feature, the percentage of the variance of the normalized
log-expression values across cells that is explained by each covariate is
calculated. Each curve corresponds to one factor and represents the distribution
of percentages across all genes. See `Lun et al. (2016)
