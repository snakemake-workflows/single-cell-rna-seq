t-SNE plot constructed from normalized log-expression values. 
Each point represents a cell.
Cells were colored by cell type.

T-SNE visualizations can be misleading, due to parameter choices and the fact
that it is non-deterministic. We therefore run t-SNE for different random seeds.
This plot shows results for seed={{ snakemake.wildcards.seed }}.
T-SNE results will only be usable for you if clustering is similar for different seeds.
