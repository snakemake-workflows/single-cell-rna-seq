Percentage of total counts assigned to the top 50 most highly-abundant features.
For each feature, each bar represents the percentage assigned to that feature
for a single cell, while the circle represents the average across all cells.
Bars are coloured by the total number of expressed features in each cell, while
circles are coloured according to whether the feature is labeled as a control
feature.

This should generally be dominated by constitutively expressed
transcripts, such as those for ribosomal or mitochondrial proteins. The presence
of other classes of features may be cause for concern if they are not consistent
with expected biology. For example, a top set containing many spike-in
transcripts suggests that too much spike-in RNA was added during library
preparation, while the absence of ribosomal proteins and/or the presence of
their pseudogenes are indicative of suboptimal alignment.
